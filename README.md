Some personal ideas

## Electrification
Since years I strongly believe in electrification of transportation. Over the years I developed some ideas which I want to disclose here.

### Share your chargepoint
Coming years, the amount of electrical vehicles on the road will explode.
I think more than many institutions expect. The amount of (public) chargepoints might become a bottleneck.
I was thinking: what if... people that have a private chargepoint can share it easily with others?
Like, airbnb for parking lots with charging capability.

So, in the near future, I might create an app where people with private charging possibities can advertise it on an app. 
Paid or unpaid. Payments can be done by duration, per kwh, or other means. "Cup of coffee included", or not.

### EV comparison site
Years ago, I started to develop a comparison site for EV's, e-rijden.nl.

A snapshot:

Goal was to gather, structure and present all infomation users that want to need.
Find find car given your needs (specs, prices), find companies related to EV's, e.g. find and compare charge providers.

At that time, it was too early. I might give it another go in the near future.
