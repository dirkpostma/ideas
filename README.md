Some personal ideas

## Electrification
Since years I strongly believe in electrification of transportation. Over the years I developed some ideas which I want to disclose here.

### Share your chargepoint
Coming years, the amount of electrical vehicles on the road will explode.
I think more than many institutions expect. The amount of (public) chargepoints might become a bottleneck.
I was thinking: what if... people that have a private chargepoint can share it easily with others?
Like, airbnb for parking lots with charging capability.

So, in the near future, I might create an app where people with private charging possibities can advertise it on an app. 
Paid or unpaid. Payments can be done by duration, per kwh, or other means. "Cup of coffee included", or not.

### EV comparison site
Years ago, I started to develop a comparison site for EV's, e-rijden.nl.

A snapshot:

Goal was to gather, structure and present all infomation users that want to need.
Find find car given your needs (specs, prices), find companies related to EV's, e.g. find and compare charge providers.

At that time, it was too early. I might give it another go in the near future.

### Charging Point Market Place

Many people don't have possibility to charge their car at home. E.g. people who live in an appartment and/or don't have a private garage or driveway. They have to use public charging station. As the EV S-curve develops, it's very likely that demand of public charging points will soon heavily exceed the supply. It's a waste of resources if cars occupy the public charging stations longer than someone really needs. Is it really necessary to charge to 90% or 100% if you only need to drive to your work tommorrow, 20km, and you can charge your car at work? Probably not. Currently there is no incentive for people to not charge their car if a charging station is available. "I charge now, just to be sure..."

Problem:
- usage of (public) charging stations is not properly aligned with the actual need
- there is no incentive for people to not charge if it's not really necessary

Possible Solution:
- create incentives for people to not occupy the charging spot if it's not really needed

Possible implementation:
- create marketplace for public (and private?) charging stations
- "I really need spot now. I bid a 10 zillion credits for a spot within 500m of coordinates C,D"
- let users earn credits or money if they handover the charging spot to someone who really needs it
